COSC302 Project 1 Writeup
Julianna Prater and Ryan Wolpert

Julianna's GitHub repo: https://github.com/frozensriracha/CS302/

Compilation command: g++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -o lib_info lib_info.cpp

For the bulk of the code, we wrote our code separately according to the steps specified in the lab writeup. 
Our code was very similar--we both used filestreams to read in the code and functions from the map and vector C++ 
libraries to read in the code, parse through it, sort it, and manipulate it to fit the requirements--so we analyzed 
the parts of the code that weren't shared and decided to incorporate whichever ones were better-written into the shared 
.cpp file. Ryan wrote the compilation command, and Julianna wrote the notes documenting our logic.
